# Hi, I'm Nurçin 🦄

I am a <b>software engineer</b> based in Antalya, Turkey.

I understand internet-related problems like websites and applications well. I can break them down into smaller parts and propose solutions in a clear way. I'm not afraid to learn new technologies on my own. My goal is to write clean, readable code that works well with different systems. I enjoy both coding and the creative process of designing. I can create products that look perfect and perform smoothly.

### Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- `React` / `NextJS` / `TypeScript` / `Tailwindcss`
- `GraphQL` / `Apollo Client`
- `React Native` / `Expo`
- `Postgres` / `Prisma`
- `NodeJS` / `NestJS`

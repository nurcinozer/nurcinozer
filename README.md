# Hi, I'm Nurçin 🦄

I am a <b>software engineer</b> based in Antalya, TURKEY.

I am able to understand problems that live on the internet, whether that be websites or applications clearly, break them down into hypotheses and propose solution in a coherent manner. I have the ability to learn <b>new technologies</b> on my own and I am not intimidated by new technologies. My goal is to always write codes that are <b>readable, clean and compatible</b>. I love what I do, and also I adore the creative process in designing, it has always been a favorite for me beside the coding. I can build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

### Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- `React` / `NextJS` / `Tailwindcss`
- `TypeScript` / `NodeJS` / `NestJS`
- `GraphQL` / `Apollo Client`
- `Postgres` / `Prisma`
- `React Native` / `Expo`

### Also, I started to interested in:

- `Blockchain` / `Smart Contracts` / `Ethereum` / `Solidity`
